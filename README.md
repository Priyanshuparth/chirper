# Chirper

Chirper is a Twitter clone developed using Flutter and Firebase. The project aims to replicate the core features of the popular social media platform, Twitter, while also addressing some of its limitations and challenges.

## Introduction

Chirper provides users with a platform to share thoughts, engage in conversations, and stay updated with real-time updates. It offers a custom user interface designed with Flutter, making it responsive across different devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: Chirper's front-end is built entirely with Flutter, Google's UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
- **Firebase**: Firebase is used for back-end services, including user authentication, data storage, and real-time database updates.
- **Firestore**: Firestore, a NoSQL cloud database provided by Firebase, is used to store user data, posts, likes, and retweets.
- **Provider**: Provider is used for state management within the Flutter app, allowing efficient management of user authentication state and data retrieval from Firestore.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up for new accounts, log in with existing accounts, and log out securely.
- **Post Creation**: Users can create posts with text, images, videos, polls, and links, allowing for diverse forms of expression.
- **Feed**: The feed displays posts from followed users and trending topics, keeping users updated with the latest content.
- **Search**: Users can search for other users and hashtags, facilitating discovery and engagement within the community.
- **Profile**: User profiles showcase information such as profile picture, banner image, bio, and follower/following counts. Users can also edit their profiles to update information.
- **Interactions**: Users can interact with posts by liking, commenting, and retweeting. These interactions are reflected in real-time across the app.
- **Notifications**: Users receive notifications for likes, comments, and follows, enabling them to stay connected and engaged with their network.
- **Follow/Unfollow**: Users can follow/unfollow other users to build connections and customize their feed based on their interests.
